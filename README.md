This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## To Run
* Run ``npm start`` in the command line
* Open the browser at localhost: 3000

## Instructions
The first screen will allow you to pick the board dimensions and the robot position. 
The second screen will allow you to give the instructions to the "robot":
* L(eft)
* R(ight)
* F(orward)

##Test
* Run ``npm test``

## Progressive enhancement
Because create-react-app was used, it comes already packed with service worker that are only enabled for production build.

## Future work
There's a lot to be done.
I guess the first thing to do would be stricter form validation, better error handling and then styling.
